# Space-Shooter-Game
A space invader influenced game (I don't own any of the imagery shown in this game, all credits go to the people who created them.)

# Rules / Objective
There are two players, red and blue. The objective is to shoot the opposing colored enemies. For example, red would shoot blue enemies and blue would shoot red enemies. The game duration is infinite and the main objective is to get as many points in as little time as possible. The enemies' speed are based off how far you are into the game. The game gets paused when you tab out.
